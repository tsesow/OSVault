OSVault
=======
This is the rather cumbersome complete source code release 
of OSVault, a rather traditional Hierarchical Storage Management
System (HSM, which is NOT High School Musical!).

This software release provides many large data storage implementations
with a data storage system that can store terabytes to petabytes of files
in a single XFS file system, using tape, cloud or blu-ray storage to
expend the local spinning disk.  Currently the largest single file 
system in production is at 700TBytes.  Test systems have been implemented
in excess of 1 Petabytes (PB).
